# Modelo Atómico Magnético
STL files for magnetic atoms educational resource

The included STL files contain all the parts you have to print.
For each atom you will have to print the sphere and the lids in the corresponding color (see table below for more details).
Before placing the lid on the spheres you have to insert the proper magnet.
The double and triple bonds are printed in two halves and goined together by two connecting cylinders, if it is a bit loose you can adjust the fit using some paper in between.

**[ Magnet Type ]**

By default the size of the neodymium magnets is 10x4 mm (a little bigger or smaller should be fine as well), however make sure to only use diametral magnetization type, otherwise some parts will repel each other instead of sticking together.

**[ STL Files ]**

In the STL folder you will find the required files for each type.

| Element  | Color | Magnets | Parts |
| -------- | ----- | ------- | ----- |
| Hydrogen | White | 1       | 1+1   |
| Oxygen   | Red   | 2       | 1+2   |
| Nitrogen | Blue  | 3       | 1+3   |
| Carbon   | Black | 4       | 1+4   |
| d/t bond | Gray  | 2       | 2+2   |
